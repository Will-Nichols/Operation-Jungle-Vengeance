IDAP mission to restore civilian functions around the Horizon Islands Archipelago

Back Story for Operation Jungle Vengeance

During the brief combat action now known as Operation Tanoa Takedown; the USSOCOM forces acted in a much larger role than their footprint would indicate. It is believed they trained an estimated 5000 Tanoan citizens to act as a guerilla force; which created a major problem for the Chinese. This guerilla force led to the Chinese to sign a ceasefire and pull the remaining forces out of the area in advance of a US led invasion force (Task Force Blazer) that consisted of Australian, New Zealand, British, Singaporean, Japanese and French troops that were enroute from Hawaii via US Navy landing ships and Carrier Battle Group. It is believed that the guerilla actions led by the USSOCOM teams accounted for more than 50% of the known Chinese losses to combat and support personnel in the Archipelago. This deficit would have allowed Task Force Blazer to land virtually unopposed and probably defeat the Chinese forces in a quick but violent operation. 
When Task Force Blazer was able to come on shore they quickly established an operating base at the Tuvanaka Airbase. The Task Force also began assisting the duly elected Tanoan government with rebuilding the civilian infrastructure as well as equipping and training the new Tanoan Defense Force and Police. The large IDAP relief large crew assisted with civilian reconstruction and ensured that the infrastructure rebuild was proceeding as it should for the populace. After 6 months Task Force Blazer was dissolved and all combat units returned to their respective countries. The US forces also had been moving into the permanent base location at Tuvanaka as previously agreed upon military training and base lease agreement that had been signed between Tanoa and the United States.  Meanwhile the large contingent of IDAP personnel rotated out to bring in their demining and civil affairs assisting program to help with the more remote areas.
These permanently based US forces would include a small rotating detachment of US Special Operations Forces as detailed by USSOCOM; to help train Tanoan Special Operations Forces and Special Police while assisting with drug and human trafficking interdiction. The primary forces located at the airbase was to be an air wing from the US Air Force and a rotating cycle of battalions from the US 25th Infantry and 3rd Marine Division on 6 month rotations. The US Navy would base 2 destroyers in the Archipelago once facilities were constructed near the Tuvanaka Airbase.
During the following year after the pull out of all Chinese CSAT backed forces, violent crime has increased as much as 50%. This is not only against individual Tanoan citizens but also against the now increasing tourist business. There has also been an increase in weapons, drugs smuggling and human trafficking activity through the ports and cities on the main island where the capital of Georgetown is located. Also the IDAP teams have had several hostages taken and no demands for ransom. They have received bloody uniforms and various body parts that have been identified as many of the kidnapped IDAP members. Tanoan Police have tried to crack down around the archipelago but have not been able to overcome some staggering losses of men and equipment. Tanoan government officials have asked for UN assistance in the form of a military peacekeeping operation. Even with US forces being based there the Tanoans do not wish to bring in troops from the US to fight this battle and they have requested that all US forces continue training the TDF and Police as before without engaging in operations around the archipelago.
As a result UN and IDAP leaders have requested NATO CTRG teams to provide security for the IDAP contingent on the ground and to assist the Tanoan Police and Defense Forces in locating and stopping these threats.
