The internation crime syndicate known as The Syndikat is also reported to have restated their drug and human trafficing operations in the region. Tanoan government officials have asked that if we confront any of them we are to eliminate them as soon as possible. If a known terrorist HVT is located in the region they will be called upon to effect an immediate action raid upon the target."

                "1. Situation",
                "After 3 months of fighting and getting hammered relentlessly the men of the 45th Division (Airborne) completed loading of the final Xian Y-20 transport aircraft at the airbase in the NW sector of the Tanoan Archipelago and also loaded the final armored vehicles into the container ship at the port and were escorted out of the Tanoan airspace and waters by aircraft and ships of the US And Australian Navy. The men of the 45th PLA Division (Airborne) and 1st Brigade PLAN had executed a brilliant attack on the Tanoan Archipelago. Unfortunately for Chinese and CSAT interests they were thwarted by a significant insurgency aimed at breaking the back of the individual chinese soldiers, aviators and marines. The Tanoan insurgents were able to do this with outstanding support from the members of the US Special Forces, who were already scheduled to be working in the region to assist TDF troops with training and establishing a permanent US military base; which the CSAT and Chinese governments were vehemently opposed to. The results were that the individual members of the Tanoan Archipelago joined the resistance of the insurgents and since almost all were former members of the TDF they were more than capable of working as a military unit and exploited weaknesses in the Chinese and CSAT logistics chain by destroying and or capturing several high value equipment depots and many chinese soldiers who were transported by the US Navy covertly back to US territory to be tried publicly for warcrimes. The court of public opinion went heavy against the Chinese and CSAT governments and forced them into accepting an unconditional peace after it was reported that the 15th PLA Airborne Brigade and the 1st Brigade PLAN were down to just a few skeleton companies out of the thousands that they invaded with just a few months before.<br/><br/>
				
				(2) Capabilities: CSAT and Chinese special operations personnel and intelligence agents are working to rebuild the pre-war network of rebels and terrorists that sent the Tanoan Archipelago into a tailspin just before they invaded. It is up to members of Task Force Red to eliminate or capture these agents, terrorists and criminals and bring them to justice.<br/><br/>(3) Most Probable Course of Action: The activity levels of the foreign agents and terrorists is very high but scattered. In order to proceed with the IDAP security mission and the kill or capture of HVT's TF Red personnel will be detailed on an as needed basis for various missions all around the archipelago.<br/><br/>b. Friendly Forces - Task Force Red:<br/><br/>US Navy SEAL Team 7 Bravo Platoon and Raven will be detailed as needed to work with IDAP personnel and the newly restored Tanoan Defense Forces and Tanoan Gendarmerie Police forces; to revitalize and secure the infrastructure that was destroyed during the conflict as well as help secure against terrorism and criminal activity in the Archipelago.<br/><br/>The local rebel and crminal forces are extremely well armed with various weapon systems and vehicles that they are able to utilize after significant stockpiles of Chinese weapons and equipment were left behind when the US Forces left the area to return before the cleanup began in earnest. The intelligence sources in the archipelago indicate that some members of the former insurgent group that fought with the US and against the Chinese forces and the collaborationist government forces have stayed in the shadows waiting for the chance to force their way onto the Tanoan people by force in an armed uprising. The members of Bravo Platoon will operate as needed with the TDF and GIGT to root out these last standing rebels against the rightful government.<br/><br/>It is unknown who leader of the rebel forces is or where their leadership is located exactly but they are believed to be working in the area of the central valley east of Georgetown. There is viable intelligence showing that CSAT/Chinese intelligence operatives are known to be working all across Tanoa trying to foment rebellion; these agents are considered targets of opportunity and should be dealt with swiftly as soon as they are located."
